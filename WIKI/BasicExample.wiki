#summary A very short example.

The following code creates a thread pool of 5 threads and runs the specified lambda function in one of the free threads in the thread pool.

{{{
auto pool = threadpool11::Pool(5);
pool.postWork(
   []{
      std::cout "Hi, I am thread #" << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;
   }
);
pool.waitAll();
pool.joinAll();
}}}
